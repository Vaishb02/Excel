Data cleaning and data visualisation in EXCEL
Here are the steps I followed
1.Data Collection: Collected data on bike purchasers, including various demographic and socioeconomic variables such as gender, income, education, homeownership status, occupation, age, and marital status.

2.Data Cleaning: In Excel, performed data cleaning, which involved removing unnecessary blanks or handling missing values to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

3.Pivot Tables: I used pivot tables to summarize and analyze the data. Pivot tables are powerful tools in Excel for aggregating, sorting, filtering, and summarizing large datasets. They allow you to quickly generate insights and explore patterns in your data.

4.Dashboard Creation: Using the insights gained from the pivot tables, I created a dashboard in Excel. A dashboard is a visual representation of data that provides a high-level overview of key metrics and trends. It typically includes charts, graphs, and other visualizations to help stakeholders understand the data more easily.

5.Dashboard Components: My dashboard likely includes visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, line charts, or tables to represent different aspects of the data, such as distribution of bike purchasers by gender, income level, education level, etc. I also included slicers and filters to allow users to interactively explore the data.
